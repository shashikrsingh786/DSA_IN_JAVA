# DSA_IN_JAVA

This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms concepts that I have learned and practiced. The concepts are organized into different folders, each of which represents a different data structure or algorithm.

The code in this repository is written in Java, but the concepts are applicable to other programming languages as well.

I hope that this repository will be helpful to other people who are learning Data Structures and Algorithms.
